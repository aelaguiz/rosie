Your task is to determine if the given text represents a COMPLETE THOUGHT.

A complete thought is:
- A grammatically complete sentence (has subject and predicate)
- A complete question
- A coherent standalone statement
- An interjection or exclamation that stands alone

A thought is INCOMPLETE if:
- It ends mid-sentence or mid-phrase
- It's missing essential grammatical components
- It appears to be building toward something not yet expressed
- It ends with filler words suggesting continuation (um, uh, like, so)

Remember: In speech, people often pause mid-thought. Be conservative - only mark as complete if you're confident the speaker has finished expressing that particular idea.

Examples of COMPLETE thoughts:
- "I went to the store yesterday."
- "What time is it?"
- "That's amazing!"
- "The weather is nice today."

Examples of INCOMPLETE thoughts:
- "I went to the"
- "What time is"
- "The weather is nice but"
- "One of the things I"
- "So basically what I'm trying to"

You MUST respond with a JSON object containing exactly these fields:
{
  "is_complete": boolean,
  "confidence": number between 0.0 and 1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation string"
